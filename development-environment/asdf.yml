# [asdf] is a programming language version manager. It's mostly used to
# mitigate conflicts when one project requires an earlier version and another
# project requires a new version of the same language.
#
# One key advantage to asdf is that it supports managing many different
# languages, including the ones I'm most familiar with: ruby, node, clojure and
# erlang.
