# Performance monitoring helps us keep an eye on how well the machine is operating.
# At present, I am doing "drop-in" performance monitoring, though I can imagine
# wanting to figure out how to set up a logging/utilization history aggregator.

# [htop] allows us to inspect running processes along with  their CPU and
# memory usage.
