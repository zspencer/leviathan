# Secure SHell (SSH) provides people access to the machine so long as the
# person attempting to access the machine has a user on the machine configured
# with their password or public key.
#
# The [openssh-server] package allows [incoming ssh connections], while
# [openssh-client] provides tools for making [outgoing ssh connections].

# In cases where there is a Universal Firewall (UFW) we open a port so
